//: Well, this playground will teach you a little bit about **how works** and **how to solve** one of today's biggest application vulnerabilities: SQL Injection.
//:
//: ## What is SQL?
//: SQL is a language used to query for specific data in a database
//:
//: ## Before we understand the security risks, let's understand better how it works, okay?
//: ## This page will introduce you to more about getting columns with SQL queries. How?
//: Change the **column variable** to `.all`, `.username`, `.password` or `.avaliableBalance` and run to see the result in our database
//: ### Are you ready? Let's go!
